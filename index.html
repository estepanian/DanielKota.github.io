                        <p>I took on a number of clients individually, the largest of which was <a href="http://www.hydrasportscustom.com">Hydrasports Custom Boats</a>. HCB contacted me to build an internal tool to help their sales team calculate and track sales quotes for clients. </p>
                        <p>HCB's unique challenge was to simplify their quoting process without reducing the customizability of their product. Previously the quotes were created manually using excel, acrobat, and other software from a workstation and maintenance of the system was tedious. HCB wanted an easy to use system that could be accessed securely from any device, allow an user to describe a boat by selecting from hundreds of options, calculate and store that quote, and provide a PDF representing a physical copy of the quote.</p>
                        <p>After speaking with a couple members of the sales team over the phone I decided to write the app as an ASP .NET web app in case the client ever wanted to combine this tool with their public facing site, which used Umbraco. The app used Bootstrap on the frontend to provide a clean, easy to use interface for all screen sizes. It also utilized Entity ORM to provide a link to the MSSQL database and Roles Security to manage the login and user management. I developed a form allowing users to detail a boat by selecting from hundreds of options and adding custom deviations. A designated admin could manage the options available for said form by using menus available only to them. Additional boat models could be described using Excel, and then imported into the app. After creating a quote, a styled printout could be generated in the form of a PDF. This PDF could be reprinted by providing a quote number.</p>
                        <p>Letter of reference from Shane Chittum, President of Hydrasports Custom, available upon request.</p>

                        <p>As a developer at iWerk I worked with small teams of fellow developers on a variety of projects for various clients. I focused primarily on .NET web stacks and mobile app development.</p>
                        <p>The largest and longest project I was assigned to was a .NET web app called <a href="http://www.designshirts.com">Design Shirts</a>, which allows an user to create a design on the site and then apply that design to a garment and have it shipped to their home or business. I worked primarily on the backend of the site, assisting the team in setting up the shop's first app to use Microsoft's Entity ORM for the backend and Git for source control. </p>
                        <p>This project was for a local business owner who operated a screen printing factory and as such client interaction was an important part of this account. I attended many meetings and calls directly with the client to discuss the sorts of data he would need to capture and track in his application. We visited the factory and spoke with the customer service agents who would guide users through the app, and spoke with them about requirements.</p>
                        <p>In addition I also worked on several iOS and Android apps, using both native code and the javascript framework Ionic.</p>

                        <p>At Hewlett-Packard I worked in the Enterprise Services division, where I would be assigned to client accounts to assist them in developing new features for exisiting applications.

                        <p>Projects at HP were backed by huge, longstanding code bases that thousands of clients relied on daily and were used to perform a wide array of tasks, even conducting a train in one instance. Working in that environment I learned to plan and test my changes carefully and contribute effictevly as a member of a large development team in an active lifecycle.</p>
