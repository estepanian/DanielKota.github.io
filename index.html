        I am an experienced software developer who has worked with many
        frameworks in both the web and mobile fields. I am very familiar with
        Object Oriented Programming theory and Model View Controller patterns
        and am currently looking for a position with a modern, organized team
        in the Southeast Michigan area. I would be very
        excited for an opportunity to contribute to a mobile project or
        explore other new areas of software develpment!

        <p>
          At my last position I was hired to help Versatrans, a local screen printing manufacturer, modernize their web ecosystem. Over the course of the last 15 months I created a series of prototypes and working models for a new ERM system that is currently being deployed in production as well as a fully functional mobile site. We used a combination of ASP.NET Core, Bootstrap 4, and Javascript hosted on a Debian 9 Stretch instance in the cloud. This kind of system provides highly scalable performance and a modern, responsive UI that is easy to maintain and based on a popular, corporate backed open source technology that is unlikely to be abandoned.

      <div class="details">
        <p>
          I took on a number of clients individually, the largest of which was
          Hydrasports Custom Boats HCB contacted me to build an internal tool
          to help their sales
          team calculate and track sales quotes for clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          HCB's unique challenge was to simplify their quoting process without
          reducing the customizability of their product. Previously the quotes
          were created manually using excel, acrobat, and other software from a
          workstation and maintenance of the system was tedious. HCB wanted an
          easy to use system that could be accessed securely from any device,
          allow an user to describe a boat by selecting from hundreds of
          options, calculate and store that quote, and provide a PDF
          representing a physical copy of the quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          After speaking with a couple members of the sales team over the phone
          I decided to write the app as an ASP .NET web app in case the client
          ever wanted to combine this tool with their public facing site, which
          used Umbraco. The app used Bootstrap on the frontend to provide a
          clean, easy to use interface for all screen sizes. It also utilized
          Entity ORM to provide a link to the MSSQL database and Roles Security
          to manage the login and user management. I developed a form allowing
          users to detail a boat by selecting from hundreds of options and
          adding custom deviations. A designated admin could manage the options
          available for said form by using menus available only to them.
          Additional boat models could be described using Excel, and then
          imported into the app. After creating a quote, a styled printout
          could be generated in the form of a PDF. This PDF could be reprinted
          by providing a quote number.
        </p>
        <p>
          The largest and longest project I was assigned to was a .NET web app
          called <a href="http://www.designshirts.com">Design Shirts</a>, which
          allows an user to create a design on the site and then apply that
          design to a garment and have it shipped to their home or business.
          I worked primarily on the backend of the site, assisting the team in
          setting up the shop's first app to use Microsoft's Entity ORM for the
          backend and Git for source control.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was for a local business owner who operated a screen
          printing factory and as such client interaction was an important part
          of this account. I attended many meetings and calls directly with the
          client to discuss the sorts of data he would need to capture and
          track in his application. We visited the factory and spoke with the
          customer service agents who would guide users through the app, and
          spoke with them about requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition I also worked on several iOS and Android apps, using both
          native code and the javascript framework Ionic.

          At Hewlett-Packard I worked in the Enterprise Services division,
          where I would be assigned to client accounts to assist them in
          developing new features for exisiting applications. I worked
          primarily on desktop and server code, writing primarily in C, C++, C#,
          and Java.

        <p>
          Projects at HP were backed by huge, longstanding code bases that
          thousands of clients relied on daily and were used to perform a wide
          array of tasks, even conducting a train in one instance. Working in
          that environment I learned to plan and test my changes carefully and
          contribute effictevly as a member of a large development team in an
          active lifecycle.
